Random forests is an ensemble machine learning model that consists of a collection of decision trees. It is called a "forest" because it is made up of many decision trees.

Like decision trees, random forests can be used for classification and regression tasks. The individual decision trees in the forest are trained on a random subset of the training data, and the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of the individual trees (for regression tasks) or by majority vote (for classification tasks).

The use of multiple decision trees in a random forest helps to reduce the overfitting that can occur when using a single decision tree. It also makes the model more robust, since the overall prediction is not based on a single decision tree, but on the collective prediction of many trees.

Random forests are relatively simple to implement and can handle both numerical and categorical input data. They are also relatively fast to train and can handle large datasets. However, they can be less interpretable than single decision trees, since the final prediction is based on the combination of many individual trees.
