Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. They are based on the idea of finding the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the different classes.

In a classification task, the goal of an SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximally separates the positive class from the negative class. For example, if we are trying to classify email as spam or not spam, the SVM would find the hyperplane that best separates the spam emails from the non-spam emails.

In a regression task, the goal of an SVM is to find the hyperplane that best fits the data. For example, if we are trying to predict the price of a house based on its size and location, the SVM would find the hyperplane that best fits the data points representing the houses.

SVMs are sensitive to the choice of the kernel function, which is used to map the input data into a higher-dimensional space. Different kernel functions can be used to model different types of relationships between the input and output variables.

SVMs are relatively simple to implement and can work well on a wide range of datasets. They are also relatively fast to train, especially for small or medium-sized datasets. However, they can be less effective on large datasets and may not scale well. They can also be sensitive to the choice of kernel function and the values of the hyperparameters.
