In linear regression, the goal is to predict a numerical value (the output or target variable) based on one or more input variables (also known as features). The model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable, which means that the change in the output variable is proportional to the change in the input variables.

Linear regression models the relationship between the input variables and the output variable using a linear equation of the form:

y = b0 + b1_x1 + b2_x2 + ... + bn*xn

where y is the predicted output, x1, x2, ..., xn are the input variables, and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the model coefficients (also known as weights or parameters). The coefficient b0 is the intercept term, which represents the predicted output when all of the input variables are 0.

To train a linear regression model, we need a dataset that includes the input variables and the corresponding correct output values. The goal is to learn the values of the coefficients b0, b1, b2, ..., bn that minimize the error between the predicted output and the correct output. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data by plugging in the input values and using the learned coefficients to calculate the predicted output.

Linear regression is a simple and widely used model, but it has some limitations. It can only model linear relationships, so it is not well-suited for problems where the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is more complex. It is also sensitive to outliers (extreme values in the input data that can have a large influence on the model).
