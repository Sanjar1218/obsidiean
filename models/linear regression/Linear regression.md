Linear regression is a type of machine learning model used to predict a numerical value based on a linear relationship between the input variables (also known as features) and the output variable (also known as the target).

In a linear regression model, the output variable is predicted by adding up the weighted input variables, plus a constant term (called the bias). The weights and the bias are parameters of the model that are learned during training, using an optimization algorithm.

For example, let's say we want to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet) and the number of bedrooms. The size of the house and the number of bedrooms would be the input variables, and the price would be the target variable. We could use a linear regression model to learn the weights and bias that give the best prediction of the price given the size and number of bedrooms.

Linear regression is called "linear" because the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is linear. This means that the change in the output variable is proportional to the change in the input variables.

Linear regression is a simple and widely used model, but it has some limitations. It can only model linear relationships, so it is not well-suited for problems where the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is more complex. However, it is fast to train and can be used as a baseline model for comparison with more complex models.
